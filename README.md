## Code Style

This project uses ESLint, Prettier and Stylelint to keep the code style consistent.

- `npm run lint` runs ESLint for JavaScript and Vue files.
- `npm run lint:style` runs Stylelint for CSS/SCSS files.
- `npm run format` formats files with Prettier.

## SEO Enhancements

### Additional SEO Features

- The **services** page outputs a `BreadcrumbList` and multiple `Service` objects in JSON-LD so that search engines better understand available care options.
- The **about** and **contact** pages include dedicated JSON-LD descriptions.
- Images use native lazy-loading to improve performance and Core Web Vitals.
- The **resources** page now outputs a `FAQPage` schema for its frequently asked questions.
- The **reviews** page includes `AggregateRating` and individual review data in JSON-LD.
